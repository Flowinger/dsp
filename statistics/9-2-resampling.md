[Think Stats Chapter 9 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html#toc90) (resampling)

Pregnancy length:

With the resampling method we get a very similar p as with the permutation method (around 16-17%).
```
P = 0.1684
```

Birth weight:

With the resampling method we also get a value of (almost) zero for p as with the permutation method.

```
P = 0.0
```
