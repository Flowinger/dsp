[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

So the 'random.random' function appears to be almost random since the PMF seems to be almost uniformaly distributed with a probabilty of 1/1000 (0.001) for each value to occur. The line of the CDF distribution is almost straight which means that the random numbers are almost distributed uniformaly.
