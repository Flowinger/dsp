[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.
Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?
```
Cohen Effect Size pregnancy length: 0.028879044654449883
Cohen Effect Size total weigth: -0.088672927072602006
 ```
In this case, the birth weight has a negative effect which means that first babies are lighter than other babies on average, although not by much.
